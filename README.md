# Challenge-2

This application is a GUI which allows users to easily add, commit, and pull using Git, while also allowing the user to search for pending pull requests and outdated repositories.

This project was made for Challenge 2 in CSC109 by Madison Badalamente, Michael Merritt, and Isaac Crawford.

More information and documentation on our application can be found here: [https://mikepmerritt.github.io/Challenge-2/](https://mikepmerritt.github.io/Challenge-2/).
