 # About the application
This application was created as an assignment for our CSC109 class. The goal was to create a new tool or feature for Git and/or GitHub. We have created the prototype of an GUI-based application.

#### What tools or features did we create?
- We started creating an application to allow a user to be more aware and notified of the status of the repository they link. The end goal is to have it inform you if you have any uncommitted changes on your repository, let you know if your local repository is outdated, and inform you of any pending merge requests.

#### Why is this useful?
- By adding in these features, GitHub users can stay more on top of the changes made in their repositories and it can make collaborative efforts more effectively. Overall, it is an additional and more convenient form of communication between Git and the user to make working on repositories more functional.
