# How to use

#### Where do I run this project?
- As of now, it is set up as just a simple java application, so you can run it like any other one.

#### What do I need to download to use this?
- In order to effectively be able to use this application, you will need to download two packages from GitHub. You can find these at the following links:
[GitSubprocessClient](https://github.com/CSC109/GitSubprocessClient) (v0.0.9)
[GitHubApiClient](https://github.com/CSC109/GitHubApiClient) (v0.0.5)
- Simply download the .jar files from the repos under the releases section and add them as extra Java packages to the project.
- When being made, the most recent versions of the GitSubprocessClient and GitHubApiClient were used along with either an openjdk-12.0.2 or version of Java.

#### Okay... that's all set up, what now?
- Once the app launches, it'll ask you to enter your username and token. Don't worry, the information is safe with us. We only need it so we can access your repositories to help you best utilize our application

#### What do I do once I am in the main menu?
From here, you have several options:
- You can link a new repository
- You can see if there are any uncommitted changes
- You can see if your local repository is up to date
- You can see if there are any pending merge requests
